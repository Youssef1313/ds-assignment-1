# Data structures II - Assignment 1

**Goal:** understand different running times for each algorithm, best and worst-case running times.

## Implementation

1. You're required to implement:

    - Three O(n<sup>2</sup>) algorithms (selection sort, bubble sort, and insertion sort).
    - Three O(nlogn) algorithms (merge sort, quick sort, and heap sort).

2. You're required to compare the running time performance of your algorithms against each other.

    To test your implementation and analyze the running time performance, generate a dataset of random numbers, and plot the relationship between the execution time of the sorting algorithm versus the input size.

## Report

A graph is required between time vs array length for the different algorithms and calculate the time required to sort it using the algorithms you implemented above and plot the results to a graph as what is shown in the image, you can use Excel sheet to achieve the job.

## Deliverables

- All the 6 sorting algorithms.
- Generate random arrays of sizes 10, 100, 1000, 10000, and 100000.

    - Do not include random arrays generation time when measuring each algorithm running time.
    - Make sure each algorithm runs on the randomly generated arrays. When you call other sorting technique, make sure that you call it with original array not the sorted one.

- Report containing the following:

    - Description of the program.
    - Pseudo code for each algorithm.
    - Sample runs.
    - Graph described earlier.
